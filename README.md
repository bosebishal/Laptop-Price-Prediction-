# Laptop-Price-Prediction
Project Description: Laptop Price Prediction for Business Optimization

This project focuses on predicting laptop prices based on factors such as screen size, RAM, CPU, model, and brand. Through the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques, the data is visualized and analyzed to facilitate accurate price predictions.

By leveraging EDA, insights are gained into the relationship between laptop prices and the specified features. Various visualizations are employed to understand price distributions and the influence of different factors on laptop pricing.

Machine Learning algorithms are then utilized to build a predictive model. Regression models, including linear regression and random forest regression, are trained using the dataset to accurately predict laptop prices.

The project addresses crucial business challenges such as pricing optimization, market positioning, and competitive analysis:

1. Pricing Optimization: Accurate price predictions enable businesses to optimize their pricing strategies, maximizing profitability and market share.

2. Market Positioning: Laptop price predictions help businesses position their products effectively in the market, considering competitor offerings and target customer segments.

3. Competitive Analysis: Accurate price predictions provide insights into competitors' pricing strategies, allowing businesses to adapt and gain a competitive edge.

This project aims to answer important questions related to optimal laptop pricing, factors influencing brand laptop prices, and the benefits of accurate price predictions. The insights gained through EDA and Machine Learning techniques empower businesses to make data-driven decisions, enhancing their competitiveness in the laptop market.
